# Exploit Host Connectivity Checker

## Synopsis

Checks various domains, over 400, on both DNS servers I host to see if they are functioning as expected. Intended to be used by end users to see if their ISP is hijacking their DNS requests and if recursive queries are enabled for their IP address.

## Usage

If using the Python script directly, install the required packages with the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

```shell
usage: main.py [-h] [--disable-ipv4] [--enable-ipv6]

Exploit Host Connectivity Checker

options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  --disable-ipv4  Disable checking IPv4 servers. Default: True
  --enable-ipv6   Enable checking IPv6 servers. Default: False
```

## Is my ISP Hijacking?

If everything responds with `FAIL` with the exception of the `Cthugha Forward` and `Ithaqua Forward` sections then your ISP is hijacking your requests.

## Notes

- The Windows exe file is created with Pyinstaller, this may trigger your anti-virus. This is a known issue and is a false positive. If you don't trust it, download Python and run the script that way.
- The code little messy but it works as expected, I don't want to expend a ton of extra effort on this. For what it is, it's good enough.
- Works with Windows (CMD, Powershell, and standalone EXE), Linux, and OSX.
- Python 3.8+
- If you enable IPv6 checking, but it's not available on your system/network, best case the checks all fail, worse case the script crashes.
